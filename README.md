## About

Base template for using Enzyme inside of [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com), which shows how to set up Google Colab to be able to use Enzyme inside of it.

## Usage

We highly recommend writing your source code, and e.g. Makefile outside of Colab and then downloading these files into your Colab at presentation time.
